# _Hit and Miss_ analysis

Analysing [my newsletter, _Hit and Miss_](https://lucascherkewski.com/hit-and-miss/).

[Initial write-up available on my blog.](https://lucascherkewski.com/study/hit-miss-fifth-anniversary-analysis/) No RMarkdown for me yet—we’ll get there!

## Initial setup and load

- Decompress `data/source/h-m-html.zip` so you have a `data/source/h-m-html/` folder, containing (at time of writing, 2022-09-11) 261 subfolders.
- in R, run `source("load.R")`.
